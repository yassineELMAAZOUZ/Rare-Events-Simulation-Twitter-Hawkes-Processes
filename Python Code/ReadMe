Ogata_Base_Code: 	 		 Contains the main tool to simulate a Hawkes process alongside other useful functions.


Ogata_Features_Base_Code:  	  	 The same as Ogata_Base_Code but with features added to the model.


ProbabilityEstimator:        		 Contains a procedure that can estimate the probability for a process to go beyond a certain value but changing the parameter lambda_0.


ProbabilityEstimatorWithFeatures:	 Same as ProbabilityEstimator but with features.


ParametersEstimator:              	 Contains a procedure that estimates the model parameters base on given data by maximizing the likelyhood functions with gradient_descent.


Distribution Drawings:   		 A file that draws distributions for two parameters in order to campare them and have an idea of what parameters to choose to get good results.

Distribution Drawings:   		 A file that draws trajectories of M process for two parameters in order to campare them and have an idea of what parameters to choose to get good results.
